# Elixir vs. C++

This project contains 2 files:
  - *fib_calc_c.cpp*: Gets the nth fibonacci number using C++
  - *fib_calc_e.ex*: Gets the nth fibonacci number using Elixir

This is a comparison between the two languages using 2 very different paragadigms, C++ being an imperative, object-oriented language, 
and Elixir being a purely functional one. The actual comparisons may be found in the comments of each respective file.

The C++ file may be compiled using the C++ compiler of your choice (ex. *clang++ fib_calc_c.cpp -o fib_calc*) and run using the command *./fib_calc*.
The Elixir file may be run by using the command *elixir fib_calc_e.ex*.
